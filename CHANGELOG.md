# Changelog

All notable changes to Mavericks are documented in this file, in a format
inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). For how the
framework actually works, see [README.md](README.md) and the core process
docs in [`docs/core/`](docs/core/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.33.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- `--archive-merged` operator command — archive merged task blocks out of
  `BACKLOG.md`'s Active Wave and `TASK_STATUS.md`'s Active tasks mid-wave,
  without waiting for the end-of-session close-out.
- Opt-in session-transcript archive — a `--transcript-archive` installer
  flag (works with fresh install, `--update`, and `--hooks-only`) activates
  a managed `SessionStart` hook that sweeps Claude Code session transcripts
  into a gitignored `.mavp/transcripts/<session-id>.jsonl` before Claude
  Code's ~30-day cleanup removes them. Off by default, local-disk only.
- Retention pruning for the transcript archive — set the
  `MAVP_TRANSCRIPT_RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable to bound the
  archive's growth; the default remains unlimited.
- Decision records gain an optional `Session:` lineage field — an opaque
  Claude Code session id pointing at the deliberation behind a record. The
  record body stays self-sufficient; the pointer is explicitly never
  load-bearing.

### Changed

- The status-sync hook now auto-creates a missing `TASK_STATUS.md` entry
  for any new `BACKLOG.md` Active Wave task, completing the
  BACKLOG→TASK_STATUS mirror automatically (deprecated and superseded
  tasks are skipped).
- Task registration in the state artifacts is documented as a
  Main-Agent-only responsibility, never delegated to sub-agent briefs.

### Fixed

- The status-sync PostToolUse hook is silent on no-ops — it only emits
  output for real errors and actual mutations, restoring the
  "silent means success" hook contract and eliminating alarm fatigue from
  routine no-op runs.

## [0.32.2] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- Cross-repo `Blocked by: <repo>/T-NNN` merge gate — the validator resolves
  the referenced repo through the repo-map registry and blocks (or warns on)
  a merge until the blocker task reaches `merged`, as a cross-repo
  complement to the existing same-repo `Depends on:` field.
- Repo-map registry (`docs/REPO_MAP.md`) — per-project registry of repo id,
  label, path, domain, and deploy metadata, used to resolve cross-repo
  references.
- RCA-to-codification (`docs/core/RCA_CODIFICATION.md`) — every root-cause
  analysis now routes each root cause to exactly one durable fix mechanism
  (rule edit, role-spec proposal, memory entry, armed recheck, or
  mechanical enforcement change), tracked by a follow-up task.
- Decision records (`docs/core/DECISIONS.md`) gain greppable lineage fields
  (`Informed by:` / `Supersedes:` / `Tasks:`) for tracing a decision through
  the tasks and log entries that acted on it.
- Publish-manifest creation-time guard plus a blocking commit-time backstop,
  so new files are classified (ship/exclude) at creation and enforced again
  before commit.
- Session start now renders an `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` notice when a newer
  framework version has been published.

### Changed

- README documents the cross-repo `Blocked by` merge gate and the new
  core-docs entries introduced above.

## [0.29.1 and earlier] — Baseline

A one-time inventory of the capabilities already established before this
changelog began:

- **Task lifecycle and state artifacts** — `BACKLOG.md`, `TASK_STATUS.md`,
  and `PROCESS_STATE.json`/`PROCESS_STATE.md` track every task through a
  defined lifecycle, enforced by a validator gate. See
  [`docs/core/TASK_LIFECYCLE.md`](docs/core/TASK_LIFECYCLE.md).
- **Operator CLI** — `scripts/mavp-operator` provides the dashboard,
  session-start briefs, task registration/status commands, wave close-out,
  and framework install/update/strip operations.
- **Sub-agent role specs** — per-role behavior definitions in
  [`.claude/agents/`](.claude/agents/), with the operating-model rules for
  how roles hand off work in [`docs/core/ROLES.md`](docs/core/ROLES.md).
- **Bootstrap and direct-reference model** — new projects are seeded via
  `mavp-install.js`, and bootstrapped projects reference this installation
  directly rather than vendoring core scripts. See
  [`docs/core/BOOTSTRAP_GUIDE.md`](docs/core/BOOTSTRAP_GUIDE.md).
- **Claude Code hooks** — `SessionStart`, `PostCompact`, and `PostToolUse`
  hooks activated by the installer, covering validator checks and
  doc-sync advisories. See
  [`docs/core/BOOTSTRAP_GUIDE.md`](docs/core/BOOTSTRAP_GUIDE.md) —
  "Claude Code hooks activation".
- **Skill-reflection loop** — mines past task outcomes and proposes bounded
  edits to role specs for human review. See
  [`docs/SKILL_OPTIMIZATION.md`](docs/SKILL_OPTIMIZATION.md).

Tags v0.23.3–v0.29.1 predate this changelog and are not individually
annotated.
